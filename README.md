# Hi, I'm Chris!

I'm a principal software architect at Axway. That's a fancy way of saying I can pretty much code anything.

I joined the team at Axway, through the Appcelerator acquisition, where I work on the next generation tooling for Axway products including the Titanium SDK. Much of what I do is JavaScript, Node.js, and open source.

My free time these days goes to deep learning, woodworking, and extremely hard DOOM megawads.
